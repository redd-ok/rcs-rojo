Pull requests are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Commit names and descriptions do not matter as long as they can clearly describe what has been changed. If pushing a big change or feature request, please create a new branch if possible. Remember to:
- Review your code
- Write strict Luau if possible
- Don't hardcode values
- Passthrough a linter (e.g. StyLua)
- Use modern alternatives rather than deprecated functions (CollectionService, Tags, etc)
